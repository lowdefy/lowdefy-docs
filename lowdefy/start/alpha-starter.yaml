            # Getting started with Lowdefy ü§ì

            ### 1. Install npm
              To run the Lowdefy cli you need to install npm [(What is npm?)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). 
              In short, npm is a package manger for Node.js, and by installing Node.js, npm is also installed.
              Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

            ### 2. Install a git client
              If you do not already have a git client setup on your machine, we recommend installing [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
              Note: Also create a Github account if you do not already have one. https://github.com/

            ### 3. Clone our Lowdefy demo repository 
              On your Github client, clone our Lowdefy demo repository into a folder on your local drive using this link:
              https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy-demo.git

            ### 4. Rum npm install üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
              In the command line, run:
              ```
              npm install -g @lowdefy/cli
              ```
              This will install the Lowdefy cli on your machine so you can run the Lowdefy cli in any folder.
              Note: For more advanced users, you can also locally install npm into the project folder.

            ### 5. Open your Lowdefy app url in a browser
              Open Lowdefy app url in a browser and you should see "Welcome to Lowdefy üöÄ".

            ### 6. Run the Lowdefy cli with your provided endpoint
              In the command line, navigate to your project folder and run: 
              ```
              lowdefy -e (paste your endpoint here)
              ```
              
            ### 7. Refresh your Lowdefy browser window ü§©
              Refresh your Lowdefy browser window and you should see the demo app loaded - If not, now is a good time to phone us!
              If it is working, congratulations üëè your Lowdefy project is now up and running
              
            ### 8. Make changes to the project files
              You can use your favorite text editor to modify the Lowdefy project üìù We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
              Saved changes to files inside your folder should propagate to your app browser when the Lowdefy cli is running in the background inside the same folder.
              
            ### 9. Refresh the Lowdefy browser window to see updates
              You need to hit refresh to load your latest config and view your changes
              If there is errors shown in the command line, you likely have invalid yaml of json üßê or some other error. The cli will not upload changes if it includes an error, so first fix these changes for app modifications to reflect in the browser.
              Note: For now we still have some errors in our schema validator, so these command line errors can be ignored and changes will upload if a schema error is displayed.

            ### 10. Happy building üë©‚Äçüíª
              Have fun, for more info checkout our docs:
              https://docs.lowdefy.com
              It is limited at the moment, so please give us a shout whenever you get stuck! 
              We know that there is lots of ways to improve on what we have build, please share your ideas and frustrations so we can learn and prioritize the best ones first - we are trying to build something super useful ‚ú® all feedback is valuable. 

            ### Extra NB:
              Until we turn on app authentication, only specific set of page ids are loaded onto the public user profile:
              These page ids include:
              ```
                page1
                page2
                page3
                page4
                page5
                page6
                page7
                page8
                page9
                page10 
              ``` 
              Create your pages with one of these ids for now and let us know if you need more. 
              Again, sorry, this is inconvenient and will be sorted as the authentication update is published.

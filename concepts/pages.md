# Pages

The pages of a Lowdefy app are defined in the pages array in the `lowdefy.yaml` configuration file. Each page defined in the pages array creates a url route for that page. For example, if a page with id `welcome` is specified, that page will be available at the url  `deployment-id.lowdefy.com/welcome` or `customdomain.com/welcome`.

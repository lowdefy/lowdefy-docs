                The `Logout` action logs a user out of their currently signed in profile. Users will bee redirected to be logged out, and redirected to the page they came from. If this page it is not a public page they will be redirected
                to the login page. Since users are redirected away from the app to log out, you shouldn't define actions after the `Logout` action.

                ### Examples

                Log a user out:
                ```
                - id: logout
                  type: Logout
                ```

            The `Fetch` action re-fetches a request, or if used during an onInit or onEnter action, fetches those requests while a page loads.
            `Fetch` can be used to fetch all requests on a page, or one request. The `Fetch` action is synchronous, actions defined after
            it will only run once all the fetched requests have returned.

            #### Page load request fetch order
            1. Requests used in onInit action are fetched. This happens even if the request is not explicitly fetched, but just referenced. The onEnter action does not start until the requests have returned.
            2. Requests used in onEnter action are fetched, just like for onInit.
            3. The remaining requests are fetched, but the page starts to render without waiting for those requests.

            ### Parameters
            - `requestId`: _String_ - The id of the request that should be fetched. If not specified, all requests on the page are fetched.

            ### Examples

            Fetch all requests by specifying no params:

            ```
            - id: fetchAll
              type: Fetch
            ```

            Fetch all requests by specifying true as param:

            > Do we still want to do this?
            ```
            - id: fetchAll
              type: Fetch
              params: true
            ```
            
            Fetch a single request:
            ```
            - id: fetchOneRequest
              type: Fetch
              params: myRequestId
            ```

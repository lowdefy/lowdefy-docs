                The `Validate` action is used to validate a users input, usually before information is inserted into a database using a mutation.
                It is used in conjunction with the `required` and `validate` fields on input blocks. If the validation fails, the `Validate`
                action will fail, and this will stop the execution of actions that are defined after it.

                The first time a `Validate` action is called, validation error are shown to the user. The `Reset` action resets this.

                Validate only validates the input blocks that are inside the context it is called from. Therefore, if you use two contexts
                to separate two forms, only the one form will be validated.

                ### Parameters
                - `blockId`: _String_ - Only validate a specific block. If this fails, other validation errors will still be visible to the user.

                ### Examples

                Fetch all requests by specifying no params:

                ```
                - id: validate
                  type: Validate
                ```

                Validate a single input:
                ```
                - id: validate_one
                  type: Validate
                  params:
                    blockId: my_text_input
                ```

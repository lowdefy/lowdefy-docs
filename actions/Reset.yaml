            The `Reset` actions resets a context to the state it was in just after the `onInit` action was executed. This clears the user's inputs.
            The `Reset` action does not take any parameters. 
            
            > The `Reset` action re-fetches all the requests on a page. 

            > Note that the `Reset` action resets the state to the state before the onEnter action is executed, and the onEnter action is not executed after
            the reset happens. This might cause unexpected behavior if you used an onEnter action to initialize the state.

            ### Examples

            A reset button:

            ```
            - id: reset_button
              type: Button
              properties:
                title: Reset
              actions:
                onClick:
                  - id: reset
                    type: Reset
            ```

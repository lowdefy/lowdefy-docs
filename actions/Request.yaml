                The `Request` action calls a request, or if used during an onInit or onEnter action, calls those requests while a page loads.
                `Request` can be used to call all requests on a page, a list of requests, or a single request. The `Request` action is synchronous, actions defined after
                it will only run once all the called requests have returned.

                To call requests that load data, the `onInitAsync` and `onEnterAsync` actions can be used. These will execute the actions while the page begins to render. If the `onInit` or `onEnter` actions are used, the page will only start rendering after the actions have completed.

                ### Parameters
                `Request` can be called without any parameters to call all requests in the context. It can also be called with a list of requestIds or a single requestId to call.

                ### Examples

                Call all requests by specifying no params:

                ```
                - id: call_all
                  type: Request
                ```

                Call a single request:
                ```
                - id: call_one_request
                  type: Request
                  params: my_request_id
                ```

                Call a list of requests:
                ```
                - id: call_many_requests
                  type: Request
                  params:
                    - my_request_id_1
                    - my_request_id_2
                    - my_request_id_3
                ```

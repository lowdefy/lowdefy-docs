            Deploy our demo app using these steps.

            ### Create a GitHub Account

            Create a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/) if you don't have one already.

            GitHub is a Git repository hosting service. A Git repository can be thought of as a folder that tracks changes made to the files inside it. GitHub allows you to share those repositories with others. You can learn more on how to use GitHub [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

            ### Fork Our Demo Repository

            Go to our [demo repository](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy-demo) on GitHub, and click the fork button. Then choose your profile, and a copy of our demo repository will be created in your demo account. You can now make changes here as you please.

            ### Sign Up For MongoDB Atlas

            Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) and click Try Free, and follow the steps. You can deploy a sandbox database for free.

            MongoDB works great with Lowdefy, it is easy to use and has powerful reporting capabilities.

            ### Load the Sample Dataset

            The demo account uses the MongoDB Atlas sample dataset, which can be loaded into your sandbox cluster.

            ### Create a Lowdefy Account

            Go to [lowdefy.com](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy-demo) and create an account.

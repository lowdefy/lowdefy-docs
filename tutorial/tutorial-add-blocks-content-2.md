### What Happened

We added 5 form input blocks to the page. For each of those blocks, we set the `title` property, and for the meeting room selector we set a list of meeting rooms to the options property.

We also added two buttons, a smaller reset button and a larger submit button. We set a few more properties on the buttons to set their layout and apperance.

 

### Up Next

Currently our form doesn't do very much. In the next section we will use [actions]() and [operators]() to make it more interactive.

The blue bar at the bottom of the screen is called the inspector. This is only visible to users with the owner or developer role, and allows you to see whats happening inside your app.

### Installing Node.js

The [Lowdefy CLI](cli) (Command Line Interface) allows you to upload changes to your app. To run the Lowdefy CLI you need to install Node.js at version 10 or greater. If you don't have it installed, download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and follow the installation steps for your computer. All of the default settings given by the installer are fine for what we need.

To test if Node.js is installed on computer, run the following from a terminal:

```bash
node --version
```

The output should look something like:
```bash
v12.18.0
```

### Text editor

To write Lowdefy configuration files you need a text editor. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but feel free to use your favorite.

We would like to add an input form with the following fields:

- A name for the meeting.
- Which meeting room should be booked. This should be a selection from a list of meeting rooms.
- The date of the meeting.
- The start and end times for the meeting.

There should also be submit and reset buttons at the bottom of the page.

Copy the following blocks and add them in the card's blocks array.

```yaml
pages:
  - id: booking
    # ...
    blocks:
      - id: content_card
        # ...
        blocks:
          - id: page_heading
            type: Title
            properties:
              content: Book a meeting room # Change the title on the page
              level: 3 # Make the title a little smaller (an html `<h3>`).

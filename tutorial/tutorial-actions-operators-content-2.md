### Validate action

We can now add a `validate()` action to the submit button. This will validate the inputs and give an error if any inputs are not filled in. We can add the validate action like this:

```yaml
pages:
  - id: booking
    # ...
    blocks:
      - id: content_card
        # ...
        blocks:
          - id: page_heading
            # ...
            # ...
            # ...
          - id: submit_button
            type: Button
            layout:
              span: 12
            properties:
              title: Submit
              block: true
              type: primary
              icon: SaveOutlined
################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
            actions:
              onClick:
                - id: validate
                  type: validate()
################ ------- Copy to here ----------- ################
```

Now if we click the submit button and all our inputs aren't complete, a message pops up saying we have validation errors on the page. All the fields that have not been completed are highlighted in red.



The result should look and work like this. The examples in this tutorial are live versions of the tutorial app, so you can verify that they work like your own app.
